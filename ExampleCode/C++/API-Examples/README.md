API Method Examples
===================

These cpp files are examples of the various methods of the iSENSE C++ Class.

Use the provided Makefile to compile them, try them out and view the source code.
In order to use the Makefile, you should be running a Debian based Linux OS - such as Debian,
Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc and have sudo access in order to install git, curl and libcurl.

Mac users may be able to use the Makefile as well.

Windows
-------
To compile in Windows, you will need to use Visual Studios Express 2013
(Professional / Community versions should also work).
[See the "Windows" directory for more information.](https://github.com/isenseDev/Teaching/tree/master/ExampleCode/C%2B%2B/Projects/Windows)
An example project is provided - however, you will need to change
the paths of the curl directory and the lib directory.

To download Visual Studios 2013, [go to the following website.](http://www.visualstudio.com/)
