    At some point this will hold all the upload related stuff for iSENSE uploading in C++
    To do:

    1) Check that you can upload to all projects, regardless of fields. (including several number fields/text fields)
        - Should only be one lat / long per project
        - Same with timestamp, double check.
        - Just need vector of vector of numbers & text fields, and perhaps associate with a name.
        - Such as "money" -> first number vector
                    "temperature" -> second number vector
                    etc
    2) Append a dataset
    3) Post using Username/Password
    4) Verify U/P and Contributor keys work by testing them.
    5) Pull down projects?
    6)

    Also a constructor that takes in project ID, Title, Label, Contributor key

    Currently can:
    1. Pull down fields
    2. Submit to basic projects

    Already setting proj ID, title, label(optional), contributor key
