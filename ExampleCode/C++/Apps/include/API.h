/*
 *    To do list:
 *
 *    1. Appending / editing datasets
 *      - Appending now works and can also pull down all the datasets in a project.
 *      - Try the edit API call and see if its useful.
 *
 *    2. Pulling data off of iSENSE, then appending to that via push_back.
 *      - This can now be done since pulling datasets works.
 *      - Need to add a way to return data in the form of some sort of map though.
 *        That way users can pull down datasets, get a map to play with and then
 *        reupload data through push_back(string) and push_back(vector)
 *
 *    3. Media objects
 *      - Since datasets are pulled down, media objects also get pulled down.
 *        Could add the same ability as datasets - return a map of media objects
 *      - Also work on allowing media objects to be pushed to iSENSE through the
 *        media objects API call
 *
 *    4. Test file that should also work as an example of all the various API methods
 *      - Boost tests now written.
 *      - Only 7 which test basic JSON uploading and appending.
 *      - Should test more areas of the API
 *
 *    5. Dice roll app to serve as another example.
 *      - Possible to rewrite it using the API now.
 *      - Should be very simple. Add it to the Makefile once completed.
 *
 *    6. Baseball app to serve as an example of pulling data and uploading it.
 *      - Requires above mentioned map of datasets.
 *      - Can use the push_back(vector) method to push data back to iSENSE.
 *
 *    7. Create a zip file for people to download for Linux / Mac.
 *      - Install script could be useful.
 *        Just need to write a bash script that install curl, git clones the repo,
 *        curls picojson.h off of the picojson repo and then runs the Makefile
 *        to test stuff.
 *
 *    Currently working on:
 *    Linux (64 bit) -> Uses a Makefile
 *    Mac OS 10.10 (64 bit) -> should work the same as Linux
 *    Windows 7 / 8.1 (64 bit) -> Requires Visual Studios
 */

/*

 * Most of the API calls expect that you have already set an email & password OR a contributor

   *    A Contributor key can append to datasets that YOUR KEY uploaded.
   *    Email & password can append to datasets YOU uploaded OR any datasets in projects YOU created.
   *
   *    NOTE: You do not need call
   *    bool get_datasets_and_mediaobjects();
   *    before using any of the editing and appending methods.
