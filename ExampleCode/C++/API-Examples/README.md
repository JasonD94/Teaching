API Method Examples
===================

These cpp files are examples of the various methods of the iSENSE C++ Class.

Use the provided Makefile to compile them, try them out and view the source code.

Note - you will need to use a Unix like OS (Linux or Mac OS), have installed cURL and libcurl
(installed by default by Mac OS!) and also have run the install script which pulls down the
API source code, places it into this directory and also pulls down the picojson header file
that the iSENSE Class depends on.
